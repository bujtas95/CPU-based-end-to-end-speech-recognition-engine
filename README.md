# CPU-based-end-to-end-speech-recognition-engine

End-to-end neural network based automatic speech recognition is a dynamically developing area emerging from other traditional methods. Beside the memory efficiency and the accuracy, novel convolutional neural networks provide outstanding speed as well.

In several industrial usage it is a real demand to realize a CPU based end-to-end speech recognition engine instead of the GPU based one, implementing a convolutional speech recognition architecture.

The starting point of my work was NVIDIAâ€™s Neural Modules (NeMo) framework and the QuartNet BxR model.
